Well, it seems you have show hidden items turned on, or maybe you where just looking through the zip. Good for you.
At this point there's no reason to hide what the easter egg is so I'll just tell you.
It's Skittles, although you probably already guessed that based on the name of the files.
He has a 1/1000 chance to randomly appear when starting the song from the main menu.
Obviously, that isn't the only way to get him to appear. If you start the song while holding down the END key, it will force the easter egg to happen.
If your keyboard doesn't have an END key, too bad I guess.
I would prefer if you didn't share this text online, but I know it's gonna happen at some point so I don't really care.
